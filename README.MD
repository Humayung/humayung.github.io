## OBJECTIVE  
I’ve been using Kotlin & Java for over 4 years, building Android apps with a focus on clean, efficient, and maintainable code.  
I’m comfortable with Kotlin’s core features and use them to solve real-world problems. I’m always looking to improve, and right now,  
I’m diving deeper into Jetpack Compose and KMM to stay up to date with Android development. My approach is to build reliable apps without overcomplicating the code.
